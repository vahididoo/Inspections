<p>
Avoid static collection fields.
</p>
<p>
Guidewire recommends that you do not use static scope declaration for fields
that an object modifies during its lifetime. Static references are shared by
all instances of the object, and misuse can lead to memory leaks.</p>

<p>
If you really require an application-scoped collection, to use as a cache, for
example, consider refactoring the static collection as a member of a Singleton,
or use a <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> to avoid memory leaks.

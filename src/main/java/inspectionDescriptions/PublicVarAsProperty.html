Don't use public class variables. Use properties instead
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
As a best practice, Guidewire recommends that you convert public variables to properties. Properties separate the
interface of an object from the implementation of its storage and retrieval.
Although Gosu supports public variables for compatibility with other languages, Guidewire strongly recommends public
properties backed by private variables instead of public variables.
The following sample Gosu code declares a private variable within a class and exposes it as a public property by using
the as keyword. This syntax makes automatic getter and setter property methods that the class instance variable backs.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
private var _firstName : String as FirstName // Delcare a public property as a private variable.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Avoid declaring public variables, as the following sample Gosu code does.
</p>

<p>
public var FirstName : String // Do not declare a public variable.
</p>

For general information, see “Properties” in the Gosu Reference Guide.

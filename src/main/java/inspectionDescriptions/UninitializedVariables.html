<p>
The inspection checks for all uninitialized variables, and then throw a warning to suggest on giving an initial value. This applies to all primitive data types, normal data types. class and interface.
<p><br>

<p>The quick fix will give a default value to your uninitialized variables, however, if it is an interface, then the inspection will only throw a warning but no quick fix in this case.
<p><br>

<p>The inspection excludes the var ones within methods. <br>
*Example:<br>
function Value(passValue: int) {}

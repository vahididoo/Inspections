Put the opening curly brace on the same line that starts a block and put the closing curly brace on its own line
<!-- tooltip end -->
Guidewire recommends the following best practices for effective use of curly braces:

<ul>
    <li>Surround every logical block, even single-statement blocks, with curly braces ({})</li>
    <li>Put the opening curly braces ({) on the same line that starts the block</li>
    <li>Put the closing curly brace (}) on the line after the last statement in the block, aligned with the starting column of the block</li>
</ul>

<em>Note: The spacing before the curly brace can be configured in Code Style Settings in the Settings page</em>
<br/><br/>

<p>
if(premium <= 1000) { // Put opening curly brace on line that starts the block.<br/>
print("The premium is " + premium) // Surround even single-line blocks with curly braces.<br/>
} // Put closing curly brace on line after last statement.

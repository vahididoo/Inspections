    </p><br>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    In Gosu, there is no need to put semicolon at the end of your statements, so in most cases, the semicolon is redundant.
    The inspection checks for redundant semicolons and quick fix will help you programmers remove it.
</p><br>

<p>However, the semicolon is needed in two cases:<br>
1. Gosu block statements such as: "var adder = \ x : Number, y : Number -> { print("I added!"); return x + y; }"<br>
2. Used after if statement to indicate end of the statement if without "{}"

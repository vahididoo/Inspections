Use single line comments format "//" instead of block comments format "/**/" in this case.
    </p>     <br>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
If a single comment occurs and it is commented with block comment format "/**/", then the inspection will throw a warning
and recommend to change to single comment format "//". The quickfix will fix it for you.
</p> <br>

*Example:
<p>
    /*Your comment here*/ (Warning) --- Quick fix --- > //Your comment here
    </p> <br>

However, the inspection excludes the case which the block comment is within a statement such as: print ("Gosu CheckStyle" /*A message*/).

Capital letters should be used to start a class name and each subsequent word in the name
<!-- tooltip end -->
<br/>

e.g.
    <ul>
        <li>StringUtility</li>
        <li>MathUtility</li>
    </ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>
    Compose class names in noun form. Start each word in the class name with an upper case letter, including the first word
</p>
<br/>

<p>
    To avoid future naming conflicts - if Guidewire adds or changes base functions and classes - Guidewire recommends that
    you append the suffix _Ext to your new functions and classes.
    For example, name a new function that calculates the days between two dates calculateDaysApart_Ext(...).

Trailing comments across multiple lines should have the same indentation
in order to be easier to read
<!-- tooltip end -->
<br/>
<p>
if (a == 2) {<br/>
return true // desired value of ’a’<br/>
}    //end of if loop<br/>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If you place two or more trailing comments in a chunk of code, indent them all to a common alignment, as the preceding
example shows.

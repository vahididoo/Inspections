Use Collection.firstWhere(...) instead.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    This is a performance consideration .Collection.where(...).single() first
    retrieves all items that match the condition and then retrieves one. Also if
    there is more than one item it throws exception.
    Instead hasMatch will return as soon as it finds the first item that matches
    the condition.

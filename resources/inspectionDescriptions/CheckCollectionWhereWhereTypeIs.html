Use Collection.hasMatch(...) instead.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    This is a performance consideration .Collection.whereTypeIs(...).count first
    retrieves all items that match the condition and then returns the number of items.
    Instead hasMatch will return as soon as it finds the first item that matches
    the condition.

Use Collection.hasMatch(...) instead.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    This is a performance consideration .Collection.where(...).hasElements first
    retrieves all items that match the condition and then checks to see if there is any match.
    Instead hasMatch will return as soon as it finds the first item that matches
    the condition.
